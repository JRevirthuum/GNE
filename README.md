# GNE
준비된 한국형 언어

## 해내겠습니다. GNE입니다.
GNE(그네)는 대한민국 최초의 샤머니즘 대통령 박ㄹ혜의 어록들을 종합하여 만든 스크립트 언어입니다. As the undeniably best presidential candidate in the 2016 language, we found that the current field of programming languages does not include any that Trump's glorious golden combover would approve of.

TrumpScript is our solution to this. It's the programming language Trump would approve of. Just like he is making America great again, we hope our efforts will make programming great again.

## Features
Our language includes several convenient features, perfect for any aspiring Presidential candidate including:
* a
* b
* s
* c
* s
* d
* f

## Grammar
ㅁㄴㅇㄹㅁㄴㅇㄹ
산술 연산자:
* `+` 와 `더하기` 는 덧셈을 합니다
* ㄴ
* ㅇ
* ㄹ

Control flow:
* a
* s

The exciting parts:
* Strings are denoted by double quotes ("I love Trump")
* The is and are keywords are used both to check for equality, and for assignment. To use for assignment, say something like * Trump is great or Democrats are dumb. To use to check for equality, do the same but append a ?. For example, you may need to ask yourself Trump is "the best"? (although we all know that would evaluate to fact anyway)


## Example
```
asdfasdflkj
```
